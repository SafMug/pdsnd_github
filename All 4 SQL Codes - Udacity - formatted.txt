/*Question 1
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. 
The following categories are considered family movies: 
Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.*/

/*Question 2
The length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to
 the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels 
(first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter)
 based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? 
 Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.*/
